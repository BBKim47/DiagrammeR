#' Combine two graphs into a single graph
#' @description Combine two graphs in order to make a new graph, merging nodes
#' and edges in the process.
#' @param x a \code{DiagrammeR} graph object to which another graph will be
#' joined. This graph should be considered the host graph as the resulting
#' graph will retain only the attributes of this graph.
#' @param y a \code{DiagrammeR} graph object that is to be joined with the graph
#' suppled as \code{x}.
#' @return a graph object of class \code{dgr_graph}.
